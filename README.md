## What is this?

The Kubernetes AI Conformance Program defines the capabilities a Kubernetes platform needs to reliably run AI and machine learning workloads. The goal is simple: if your AI application works on one conformant platform, it should work on others too—with fewer "it works on my cluster" surprises.

### Why does this matter?

AI/ML workloads tend to stress clusters in unique ways (accelerators, bursty traffic, and strict isolation). Today, those capabilities vary across platforms. This program aims to:

- Make AI/ML workloads more portable across Kubernetes platforms
- Reduce platform-specific workarounds and "it works on my cluster" surprises
- Give the AI tooling ecosystem a clear baseline to build and test against

### What workloads does this cover?

We're focusing on the most common AI/ML use cases:

- **Training** - Distributed or large training jobs that need accelerators and predictable scheduling
- **Inference** - Model/LLM serving where latency, routing, and scaling matter
- **Agentic workloads** - Multi-step workflows that combine tools, memory, and long-running tasks

## Getting Started

### For Vendors

If you provide a Kubernetes platform and want to get certified, here's what you need to know.

Most submissions are a completed checklist plus links to public evidence—think of it as a structured, reviewable self-assessment.

**Before you start:** Your platform must already be [Kubernetes Conformant](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance). AI conformance builds on top of base Kubernetes conformance.

#### The certification process

1. **Prepare** - Review the [certification requirements](terms-conditions/Certified_AI_Platform.md) and make sure your platform meets them
2. **Document** - Fill out the conformance checklist and gather evidence (documentation, test results, etc.)
3. **Submit** - Create a pull request with your submission to the https://github.com/cncf/k8s-ai-conformance repo.
4. **Review** - CNCF reviews your submission (typically takes up to 10 business days)

#### What you'll need to submit

- A completed conformance checklist (YAML file)
- Public documentation showing how your platform meets each requirement
- Your product logo in vector format (SVG, EPS, or AI)
- Proof of Kubernetes conformance

**Note:** Today, certification is based on self-assessment. Automated conformance tests are planned for 2026.

For detailed instructions on what to include, see [instructions.md](instructions.md#contents-of-the-pr).

### For Contributors

The program is a community-led effort to establish a vendor-neutral baseline for AI portability. We welcome participation from all stakeholders, including end users, to ensure the standard remains independent and effective.

#### Ways to contribute

| Area | What you can do |
|------|----------------|
| **Documentation** | Help improve guides, add examples, fix typos, clarify confusing parts |
| **Research** | Identify requirements for new AI workload types (especially agentic workloads) |
| **Testing** | Help develop automated conformance tests |
| **Discussion** | Participate in project meetings and design discussions |

#### How to get involved

1. [Open an issue](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/ai-conformance/issues) — have an idea, question, or suggestion? Start here.
2. Join the [AI Conformance project meetings](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-architecture#meetings).
3. Check out the [project boards](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/ai-conformance/projects?query=is%3Aopen) to see what's in progress.

## How Certification Works

```mermaid

    A[Platform must be Kubernetes Conformant] --> B[Complete self-assessment checklist]
    B --> C[Gather evidence and documentation]
    C --> D[Submit pull request]
    D --> E[CNCF reviews submission]
    E -->|Approved| F[Certified for 1 year]
    E -->|Needs changes| B
```

**Important notes:**

- Certifications are valid for one year and must be renewed
- Certification is per-product and per-configuration (e.g., cloud vs air-gapped)
- The conformance requirements are aligned with Kubernetes release cycles

## Requirements Overview

Platforms need to demonstrate capabilities across several areas: accelerators, networking, scheduling, observability, security, and operator support. The specifics evolve with each Kubernetes release.

For the full and up-to-date requirements, see the [conformance versions](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/wg-ai-conformance/tree/main/conformance-versions) in the WG repo.
