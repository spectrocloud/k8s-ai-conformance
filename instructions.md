# How to submit conformance results

## The self assessment

The set of conformance requirements for each Kubernetes version are defined in the `AiConformance-x.yy.yaml` in the [docs](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-ai-conformance/tree/main/docs) folder. 

## Submitting the self assessment 

Prepare a PR to
[https://github.com/cncf/k8s-ai-conformance](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-ai-conformance).
Here are [directions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to
prepare a pull request from a fork.
In the descriptions below, `X.Y` refers to the kubernetes major and minor
version, and `$dir` is a short subdirectory name to hold the results for your
product.  Examples would be `gke` or `openshift`.


### Contents of the PR

You must submit the completed self assesment manifest file for the relevant major/minor version of Kubernetes. 

```
vX.Y/$dir/PRODUCT.yaml: See below.
```

```

### Requirements

The self conformance file must be submitted without adjustments or changes in spec to the fields `id, description, level`.
The fields `status, evidence, and notes` need to be filled if the `level` is `MUST`.

To reach conformance all `MUST` spec fields need to be addressed and the evidence needs to be publicly reachable. 


## Amendment for Private Review

If you require a private review for an unreleased product, please email a .zip file containing what you would otherwise submit
as a pull request to conformance@cncf.io and the documentation for the evidence. We'll review and confirm that you are ready to be Certified AI Kubernetes Platform
as soon as you open the pull request. We can then often arrange to accept your pull request soon after you make it, at which point you become Certified Kubernetes.

## Review

A reviewer will comment on and/or accept your pull request, typically within 10 business days. If you don't see a response, please contact conformance@cncf.io.

## Issues

If you encounter issues with the conformance program itself during certification (rather than problems with your own implementation), you can file an issue in the [repository](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-ai-conformance).

Questions and comments can also be sent to the [AI Conformance](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/wg-ai-conformance) working group, which is the change controller of the conformance definition. You can also reach the community on [Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C09813W8DC2).
